# 4040/2020 Frame BOM - 350mm Voron #
This is the BOM i created if you want to use 4040 and 2040 extrusions for you frame. I replaced the 4 Verticals with 4040s. In the original BOM it calls for 10 HFSB5-2020-470-TPW, these are intended for the 8 laterals and 2 bed supports. I swapped out the 8 laterals for 2040s and extended the 2 bed supports by 40mm so they can be bind jointed to the frame.  
Using this as your frame does not change any of the positions of the printer components. Below is the Misumi part numbers I used. 


There are feet I created to fit this frame and they can be found here
