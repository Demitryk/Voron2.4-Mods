# 4040/2020 Frame BOM = 350mm Voron#
This is the BOM i created if you want to use 4040 and 2040 extrusions for you frame. I replaced the 4 Verticals with 4040s. In the original BOM it calls for 10 HFSB5-2020-470-TPW, these are intended for the 8 laterals and 2 bed supports. I swapped out the 8 laterals for 2040s and extended the 2 bed supports by 40mm so they can be bind jointed to the frame.  

Using this as your frame does not change any of the positions of the printer components. Below is the Misumi part numbers I used. 


----Original BOM 	                Qty  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-340	            1  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-530-LCP-RCP	    4  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-470-TPW	        10 	   
Misumi HFSB5-2020-450	            2  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-430	            1  


----4040/2040 BOM	                  Qty	          Notes  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-340	              1	            XY Gantry Rear  
Misumi HFSB5-4040-530-LCP-RCP	      4	            Verticals  
Misumi HFSB5-2040-470-TPW	          8	            Laterals   
Misumi HFSB5-2020-510-TPW-LCV-RCV	  2	            Bed Supports, 40mm longer, drilled for bind joint    
Misumi HFSB5-2020-450	              2	            Y rails  
Misumi HFSB5-2020-430	              1	            X rail  
  
  
Note: if you do not want to bind joint them, have the original length, and want them mounted the original way
replace the two Misumi HFSB5-2020-510-TPW-LCV-RCV with HFSB5-2020-470-TPW
