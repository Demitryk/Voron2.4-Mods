# Backlit Voron Logo #  
  
***This logo is 12mm thick. will not fit in on a standard framed Voron back panel***  
  
Another option for the back deck artwork. This requires you to drill 6 holes in the back panel using the drill hole guide.

### What You Need ###  
---Printed Pieces  
- Logo Frame x1 - Any Color  
- Logo Middle x1 - Clear  
- Logo Side x2 - Clear  
- Outer Ring x1 - Clear  
  
for clear printed pieces I used a honeycomb infill with 4 top layers to obtain that hexagon effect.    
  
  
---Hardware  
- 5 x M3 Threaded Inserts   
- 5 x M3 8mm Socket Screws  
- Foam tape
- COD LEDs   
  
NOTE: LEDs strips cannot be more that 9mm tall or 2mm thick. I designed this to be used with COB LEDs. These give a continuous strip of light. They do come in 12V, 24V, and 5V addressable RGB. i used 6000K white.  

Hereâ€™s is a link to the ones i used:

### Installation ###  

---Threaded Inserts and LEDs 
The 5 threaded m3 inserts are placed as shown. LEDs should be routed as shown in red. I would solder the wire to the LEDs before routing

--- Instructions  
- Print pieces   
- Install threaded inserts  
- Install LEDs  
- Center the drill hole guide on the back panel and drill the 6 holes. The bottom hole is to route the wire though the back.  
- Place foam tape on the back side of the outer ring and on the back side of the logo pieces. this will force them to be squished and keep pieces from rattling  
- install the screws, they should go through the back panel into the Logo frame
