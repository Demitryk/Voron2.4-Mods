# Bed Disconnect #
This is a quick bed disconnect. I used a GX20 Aviation 5 pin connector. These connectors are capable of 10A. I use a 750-watt bed in the US (750/120 VAC = 6.25), meaning it will draw around 6.25A. I used a 5 pin so all the connections required for the bed are in one connection: thermistor+, thermistor-, ground, neutral, and AC from the SSR. Using these connectors will require soldering. Use shrink tubbing as shown in the images to isolate wires.

## Warning ##  
The connectors are the wrong polarity in terms of safety. The connector in the printed housing should have female pins since itâ€™s the live side. I could not find the reversed layout of the connector type. This means there will be your bed supply voltage at the exposed male pins if you have it disconnected while the bed is heating.  
  
DO NOT DISCONNECT WHILE THERE IS POWER TO YOUR PRINTER...USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
