# Stealth Burner LGX Mount #
This is the LXG adapter for the stealth burner. Itâ€™s just one piece. It fits the profile of the stealth burner. The tolerances are tight. test fit the pfet tube before mounting. it may require a few scrapes using a m3 screw to get the PFET tube to fit. It requires 4 threaded inserts, two in the front and two in the rear. I designed it to fit the gantry mount with the two mgn9 rails.   
  
I have included an Stelthburner LGX adapter for the ERCF but i have NOT tested it yet. i just subtracted the same geometery as the one on the ERCF github
  
  
Included are also my cable chain mount and the connector housing for a 24 pin micro-fit V3 connector. these are not needed to use the adapter. the cable chain mount gets attached to the rear of the LGX motor. I only designed it for an Igus chain. the connector housing mounts to the cable chain mount via threaded inserts
