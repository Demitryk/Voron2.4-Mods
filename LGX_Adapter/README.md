# Stealth Burner LGX Mount #
This is the LXG adapter for the stealth burner. Its just one piece. It fits the profile of the stealth burner. The tolerances are tight. test fit the pfet tube before mountng. it may require a few scrapes using a m3 screw to get the PFET tube to fit.   
  
Included are also my cable chain mount and the connector housing for a 24 pin microfit V3 connector. these are not needed to use the adapter. the cable chain mount gets attached to the rear of the LGX motor. i only designed it for an igus chain. the connector housing mounts to the cable chain mount via threaded inserts
