# Skirt Button Mod #
These are the front skirts that I modified to install buttons. In the left skirt, there are 3 x 19mm holes that allow the installation of switches. The right skirt contains 2 slots for micro-SD card extenders (for the Pi and control board) and 1 hole of and aviation style connector (16mm). I planned on using the aviation connector for the ADXL345 connection to the Pi.

### Installing The SD Slots ###
The two printed SD Slot retainers must be glued into place. i used super glue. The micro-SD extender can be held in place by some VBH tape.
